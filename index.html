    <h4> I am a budding and upcoming software developer who throughout the course of my career ,have perfected  technical analysis and product development abilities. I am a capable and consistent problem-solver skilled at prioritizing and managing projects with proficiency. I want to venture into development to create awareness for young black men that do not have a positive role model. Tech provides oppourtunity to be able to freelance as well as create and work for a company, It is a whole world that is not spoken about.
